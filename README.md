# Alaskan Crow Data Exploration and Machine Learning in R

This project uses R to explore and prepare data for machine learning algorithms. The subject of the data includes information on Alaskan crows. The majority of the subjects showed evidence of AKD (Avian Keratin Disorder) which means the beak of the bird shows deformities. Blood samples were taken from each subject and tested for three different pathogens. The project seeks to explore what data science strategies can be applied to these data to find patterns and trends in detecting either of the three blood pathogens and the presence of AKD.
